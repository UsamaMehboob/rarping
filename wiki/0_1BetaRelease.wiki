=  Rarping version 0.1 beta available! =

I have just committed changes to reach the 0.1 beta version. Rarping won't get new features next days, time to test it for a first stable version.
Nevertheless, feel free to submit patches and/or suggestions if you're thinking to cool features for Rarping.



== List of currently available options ==

Following options are implemented in Version 0.1 beta (to version 0.1 stable) :

  * -c [count] is used to specify the number of requests to perform
  * -a [IP address] allows user to send replies instead of requests, [IP address] is the content of the reply, in `.' notation.
  * -t [timeout] sets the send/recv timeout value to [timeout] milliseconds (default 1000)
  * -w [delay] sets the delay between two probes to [delay] milliseconds (default 1000)
  * -r [retries] Abort after [retries] unanswered probes (default none)


A description of the Rarping's command line syntax is given using -h (or any invalid command line)
